              | “Rat Tuesday” is our weekly group run. Anyone is free to drop in and join! Our club is aimed at those who feel comfortable running 7K or more, continuously, at any pace. Each week our rotating crew of run captains choose routes of 7K, 10K and 13K. Our members run at a range of paces, so you’re likely to find someone going your speed and distance. We also have a Moderate Pacer every week who runs at the pace of the last runner, so no one is left behind.

              | There are no formal changing facilities available. There are limited washrooms, but it can get busy, so it’s best to come ready to run. You can leave a bag the store, though it’s best to avoid leaving valuables.

              | It’s free to try and free to join! If it’s your first time, please come around 6:05, introduce yourself, and fill out the sign-up sheet. Run with us three times and you’re a Rat!
