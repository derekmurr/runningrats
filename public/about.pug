        p.intro-text
          | The Rats started in 2002. A group of spirited runners from Toronto were training for that spring's Ottawa Marathon as part of the Commerce Court Running Room's training clinic (back when there was a Running Room in Commerce Court). After the race, the group just kept on running together, coming up with the name that summer and boasting a whole dozen members. By the winter, Rat Tuesdays were officially a thing, and the rest is history. Over fifteen years later, we're still running strong and when the weather's nice we can easily get 30 or 40 people running through the Financial District on a Tueday evening. Here's to fifteen more!

          | Okay, we all tease Mike for holding his GoPro camera in his mouth when he runs. But the fact is, the guy gets some great photos out of it, so who are we to argue with success! Here's a sample of some of our adventures together.

We run all year long, rain or shine, with 7K, 10K and 13K options and people running a range of paces every week. We're a friendly, inclusive group: all ages, genders and paces welcome. All we ask is that you can complete 7K comfortably.
