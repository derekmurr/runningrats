				<h2>Update on <span class="light">our hiatus</span></h2>
				<p class="announcement-text">We hope you are well in these strange times. We really miss our RunningRats community and all the fun that comes with
					running and socializing with everyone. As Toronto moves into stage 3, we know you may have questions about whether we
					can start to run together again.</p>
				<p class="announcement-text">The RunningRats have always been a very inclusive group that welcomes everyone. We have had the good fortune of very
					well attended runs and it’s always pleased me to see what a strong presence we have on the streets of Toronto.
					However,
					it is that attribute that concerns me most about restarting group runs at this time. We have a duty of care for our
					members and community at large. The streets and paths are continuing to be crowded and it can be difficult to
					navigate,
					even as a lone runner. With that in mind, it becomes difficult to imagine a scenario where we can maintain social
					distance between ourselves and other pedestrians. We are continuing to consider and plan for how we can eventually
					restart our group runs. Some of the things to be considered are:</p>
				<ul class="announcement-text">
					<li>An outdoor meet point</li>
					<li>Loss of amenities such as bag check and washrooms</li>
					<li>Appropriate routes that utilize less populated streets and paths</li>
					<li>How to handle intake of new members and waivers</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="announcement-text">We welcome your input and feedback on these considerations, what you think would be okay situations for group running
					and anything else on your mind.</p>
				<p class="announcement-text">Toronto and Canada at large, have performed relatively well in containing the spread of Covid-19. However, the
					pandemic
					is still very much alive. At this time, we choose to be prudent and take the cautious route, to protect the health of
					our friends and loved ones, to lower the risk of further spreading this pandemic. Group runs will continue to be on
					hold
					and we will continue to monitor the situation as it evolves.</p>
				<p class="announcement-text">Stay safe out there and Run with the Spirit! </p>

        <h2>Important note <span class="light">about COVID-19</span></h2>
				<p class="announcement-text">The spread of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has introduced much uncertainty in our day to day lives. We are all runners
        at heart and want to maintain our hard-won training and fitness. Group running presents some unique factors to consider. Running with friends is motivating, especially with goal races getting cancelled and we all know what a fun and welcoming group the RunningRats are. However, prolonged exercise in proximity to others adds a transmission risk. </p>
				<p class="announcement-text">The Rats are typically a larger group and we have had the fortune of seeing 30+ runners on most runs. With that consideration and to help mitigate the health risk to our members, <strong>the RunningRats will be pausing our Tuesday runs until further notice.</strong> As the situation is developing rapidly, we will be regularly assessing to determine when we should run together again. </p>
				<p class="announcement-text">As of March 16, our hosts at the Running Room have also cancelled their Run Club until further notice, as well as postponing all their Clinics until further notice.</p>
				<p class="announcement-text">In the meantime, continue sharing your workouts online by tagging your Instagram workouts with @runningratsto and join
        the <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/runningrats">RunningRats Strava Group.</a></p>
        <p class="announcement-text">Here are some helpful things to consider if you are running in a group:</p>
        <ul class="announcement-text">
          <li>try to maintain 2m/6ft separation between runners</li>
          <li>avoid physical contact, including high-fives and hugs</li>
          <li>meet up outdoors or in less confined spaces</li>
          <li>avoid lingering around after the run and shower asap</li>
          <li>avoid sharing water and food</li>
          <li>if you have any mild cold/flu symptoms, avoid group running entirely</li>
          <li>no snot rockets!</li>
        </ul>
